# bacteria-genome-annotation-phages
Annotation of bacteria genomes from a phage perspective

### Bacteria genome annotations for specific questions:

#### Antibiotic resistance genes

CARD in BV-VCR: https://www.bv-brc.org/

#### Phage defense systems

https://defensefinder.mdmlab.fr/

#### Prophages

https://phaster.ca/


### Materials

#### 1. Assembled bacteria genome

Once a bacteria gneome is sequenced, you have several small pieces of the genome (aka reads). They need to be pieced together (aka assembled) into ideally a single bacteria chromosome.

We already have this for the Klebsiella genomes. Go inside each bacteria folder and identify the file that is named as "KP96.fasta", download that file into your computer. We'll use this file for the different analysis tools. 

#### This is the folder with the Klebsiella genomes:

#### 3. Output

#### Upload the files for antibiotic resistance genes here:

Save the file as .csv and name it: "KP96-CARD.csv"

https://ln5.sync.com/dl/18986c030/adne3wa2-55v6dqmc-iufnr2p6-ki2dyfqu

#### Upload the files for defense systems here:

https://ln5.sync.com/dl/76d6e5f50/szjjnhak-eaikjjmz-ncdyrjk5-dxw5ud4z

1. Download the complete analysis folder
2. Decompress the files
3. Get the file named "defense-finder-systems"
4. Rename the file to include the bacteria strain ID: "KP96-defense-finder-systems"
5. Upload the renamed file to sync

#### Upload the files for prophages here:
